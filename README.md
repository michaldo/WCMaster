# WCMaster

WCMaster is software contest. No limits, no prizes.

## Task

Implement in Java functionality provided by Unix **wc**. Client pass one or more `java.io.File` objects and get total number of lines, total number of chars or both. (Requirents are limited comparing to **wc**)

## Contest purpose

I want to compare different design approaches and select one I like most. You may compare your solution with my favourite and agree or not. 

## How to contribute

1. Fork
2. Implement
3. Pull request

## Rules

1. Functionality must be implemented in Java. Call native **wc** is not allowed.
2. JUnit `wcmaster.WCTest` must be implemented and pass
3. Deadline is 5 April 2015
4. Contest is anonymous as github is.

## FAQ

1. Why JUnit test is a scratch and dummy body?
    - I don't want to suggest any API
2. How to handle errors?
    - There is no test for errors.
3. I have other question
    - If there is no answer on `wcmaster.WCTest` or on `wc --help` or on `man wc` there is no answer at all. All or answers are correct. Or question is stupid. Or whatever
